Boss Checklist lets you view a boss checklist while playing so you can progress through bosses as you can handle them. 

Toggle the checklist with the hotkey assigned to it in the settings. 

The following mods are currently supported: ThoriumMod, Bluemagic, SacredTools, CalamityMod, JoostMod

Adding more mods is easy, as the mod is hosted on github. If you would like a mod to be supported, please encourage the modder to add their mod to this mod.

Future Feature ideas: Minibosses filter, Town NPC checklist, more supported mods, summon help, whatever else by popular demand.
